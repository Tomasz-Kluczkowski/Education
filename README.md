# EDUCATION REPOSITORY - LOOSE NOTES, EXPERIMENTS AND EXAMPLES.

In this repo you can find all the examples I went through the first 3 months of my programming education.
It is purposefully left as is without any refactoring to look at it in the future and ponder how far I managed to go from the "hello world" days.

I am sure I will have a laugh at my own skills from those times :).

Anyways: enjoy browsing through it.

### What you can find in there?

- Completed code exercises from the great "Think like a computer scientist" book.
- My attempts to understand object oriented programming.
- some basic games to apply beginner programming skills to use.

It's nice to have a history to show :).
