"""You go on a wonderful holiday (perhaps to jail, if you donâ€™t like happy exercises) leaving
on day number 3 (a Wednesday). You return home after 137 sleeps. Write a general
version of the program which asks for the starting day number, and the length of your
stay, and it will tell you the name of day of the week you will return on."""

''' days are numbered from 0 to 6.
0 - sunday
1 - monday
2 - tuesday
3 - wednesday
4 - thursday
5 - friday
6 - saturday

'''the best approach would be to create a list of days and slice it according to what number we get as an imput, but we have not covered this in the book yet so we are going to use chained conditionals if elif else
