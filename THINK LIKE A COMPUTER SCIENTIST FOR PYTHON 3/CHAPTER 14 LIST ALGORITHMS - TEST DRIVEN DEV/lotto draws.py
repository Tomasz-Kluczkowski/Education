f.Write a function that repeatedly makes a new draw, and compares the draw to the four tickets.
i.Count how many draws are needed until one of the computer scientistâ€™s tickets has at least 3 correct picks. Try the experiment twenty times, and average out the number of draws needed.
ii.How many draws are needed, on average, before she gets at least 4 picks correct?
iii.How many draws are needed, on average, before she gets at least 5 correct? (Hint: this might take a while. It would be nice if you could print some dots, like a progress bar, to show when each of the 20 experiments has completed.)

Notice that we have difficulty constructing test cases here, because our random numbers are not deterministic. Automated testing only really works if you already know what the answer should be!
